### Mission

#### Lecturepad

TBD

#### Eloquentlog

To support people to get profound impressions by each other through getting things done.
In other words, activity logging made easy.

#### Scrolliris

To encourage authors to write longer texts on the web.  
In addition to this, to support improving reading experience of their texts.

As an attempt to explore opportunities for transparent and stable business along with open source software, we also obtained related software patents in Germany, Switzerland and Japan. And we allowed them to lapse as public ideas.
